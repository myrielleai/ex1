<p>Matcha is a high-grade green tea ground into powdered form.
The green tea powder is whisked into hot water, instead of steeped, to form a frothy drink.
The meditative act of preparing, presenting, and sipping matcha is the backbone of the Japanese tea ceremony.
While matcha’s origins are ceremonial, the green tea powder is widely popular around the world in beverages like tea lattes or boba tea,
and as a cooking ingredient in everything from ice cream to salad dressing.</p>
<p>Matcha is a powder made from ground-up green tea leaves and is often brewed into tea.
The practice of brewing matcha tea is Japanese in origin and the word matcha means “ground tea” in the Japanese language.
The powder is whisked into hot water to form an earthy tea often enjoyed in Japanese tea ceremonies, but interest and consumption of
matcha is now increasing around the world. You can now commonly find matcha options, from lattes to desserts, in various coffee shops and bakeries.

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">DISCUSSION</h2>
<h3 style="font-size: 30px;">ORIGINS OF MATCHA</h3>
<p>Before there were teapots to steep tea leaves,
early Chinese custom was to grind tea leaves into a powder then whip or beat
the ground tea in a bowl with hot water.  While “beaten tea” was later abandoned
the method.</p>
One of Japan’s own Zen priests studying in China’s Buddhist 
monasteries returned to Japan in the early 12th century with tea plant seeds and 
bushes. The young priest, called Eisai, used his experience in China growing and 
drinking “beaten tea” to popularize what he called “the way of tea” as a meditation 
ritual within his community of Japanese Buddhist monks. Eventually,
he spread the tea drinking custom throughout the rest of Japan.</p>
<p>This ceremonial tea drinking was taken up with a fervor by Japan’s samurai 
class. The samurai were fearsome warriors yet cultured and high ranking 
members of Japanese caste society. The samurai identity was built on Zen 
Buddhism, practicing principles like discipline, ritual, and purification. 
It is said the samurai developed the Japanese tea ceremony into an art form 
and cultural tradition by adding hundreds of detailed steps to the practice, 
including specific hand movements, the proper design of the tea room, and 
instructions for how to sit and how to prepare and sip the tea. It is also 
said the tea ceremony was integral to samurai training, helping the warriors 
sharpen their focus, concentration, and patience in preparation for battle.</p>
<p>The Japanese tea ceremony, still called The Way of Tea, is a 
revered practice in Japan and is centered around the art of preparing and 
presenting matcha in an almost meditative fashion. It was originally developed 
as a spiritual practice and the principals of the practice—harmony, respect, 
purity, and tranquility—are still central to tea ceremony today.</p>

<section id="FLAVOR" style="padding: 20px 40px;">
<p>
Since matcha is whisked into hot water, there is a unique richness to matcha that the extraction of a traditionally brewed tea leaf does not produce. Some common traits used to describe the overall flavor and texture of matcha include: vegetal, sweet, rich, creamy, wheatgrass, slightly astringent, full-bodied, and frothy.

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">TYPES OF MATCHA</h2>

<ol style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 40px;">
<li>
<h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Ceremonial Grade</h3>
<p>
Ceremonial grade is the highest quality matcha from the most carefully cultivated buds and leaves. Ceremonial grade is given the most attention to detail during processing to yield the freshest, most delicate tasting, and smoothest ground matcha. Ceremonial grade is meant to be enjoyed on its own, with no other sweeteners or additives, to really enjoy and appreciate the intended flavor.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Culinary Grade</h3>
<p>
Culinary grade matcha has a more robust, astringent flavor that can stand up to other ingredients it's paired with. It may include ground leaves that still had some stems and veins attached, it may be a slightly duller green than ceremonial grade, and it may often include a mix of matcha powder from several sources. Culinary grade can still be whisked into tea and sipped; in fact, it’s a great matcha to mix with milk for lattes or spirits for cocktails. It’s also a bit less expensive, so it’s more affordable to stock as a cooking ingredient.

<p>Matcha is prepared differently from a typical brewed tea and is very easy to make if you have the right tools.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Bring 100 mg (about 1/3 cup) filtered or spring water to a boil. Remove from heat and let cool for 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place 1/2 teaspoon matcha powder in a small bowl. Add a splash of the hot water and mix with a bamboo whisk to form a smooth paste.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add remaining water to the bowl and stir with the bamboo whisk, flicking the whisk back and forth, until matcha is incorporated and you get a thin frothy foam on top.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sip, savor, and enjoy.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">TIPS</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t have a bamboo whisk, use a spoon or small wire whisk—you just won’t get much of the frothy texture traditionally prepared matcha is known for.</li>
<li>Don’t be tempted to pour boiling water over matcha; you will scorch the ground tea powder and it will become bitter and astringent.</li>
<li>Use 1/4 cup water for a thicker matcha or 1/2 cup water for a thinner version.</li>
<li>Replace water with your favorite milk (regular, coconut, almond, soy) for a latte.</li>
<li>Pour the just prepared matcha over a glass full of ice for an iced tea version.</li>
</ul>
